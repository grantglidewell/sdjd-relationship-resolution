## Manager UI

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>See all the content associated with an instance</li>
    <li>Edit content, including metadata and various fields</li>
    <li>Publish content and iterate on versions</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
  We recently released our new content management ui. This was built in react and redux and relies heavily on a new golang rest api. This was a huge undertaking, as we were re-building our core product. Some issues we hit along the way were new problems, previously the app was a monolith, and now we were creating with an independent front and back end. This means we are now relying on calls to an api rather than directly hooking into a database. There are clear advantages with this approach, one being the code can be much cleaner as it’s purpose becomes more singular. I did, however, make some actions more difficult. One of those issues came in the form of relationships.

## The Problem

<Image src="listview.png" size="80%" />
<Notes>
In Zesty users can create content with completely custom data models. This means in many cases they want to create relationships between content. say pages that relate to one another in a specific way, an author that has written an article, or labeling certain content with tags. On the surface this seems simple enough.

## The Problem

<Notes>
 We get an article for a user to edit, if the article has relationships we fetch the associated piece of data. However relationships usually point to a certain field on a piece of content, which requires you to lookup a field, requiring the content’s model, to reference a specific value. So now we’re dealing with a whole process to resolve.

## Solutions

### App Layers

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Presentation Components</li>
    <li>Container Components</li>
    <li>Routing (HashRouter)</li>
    <li>Redux Store</li>
    <li>External Resources</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Component level resolution

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Container components know what is and is not in the store</li>
    <li>The have the ability to dispatch actions</li>
    <li style={{color:'orange'}}>HOWEVER...</li>
    <li style={{color:'red'}}>They are UI, and should be decoupled from the store</li>
    <li style={{color:'red'}}>This can lead to overly complex components</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

## Solutions

<Notes>
  Here we see that the relationship column in this list view has multiple
  relationships that resolve to the same content.
