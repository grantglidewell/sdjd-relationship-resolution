```notes
  We recently released our new content management ui. This was a huge undertaking, were re-building our core product. Previously the app was a PHP monolith, our new release is built in React/Redux and relies heavily on a new golang rest api. This means we are now relying on calls to an api rather than directly manipulating a database. There are clear advantages with this approach, one being the code can be much cleaner as itâ€™s purpose becomes more singular. It did, however, make some actions more difficult. One of those issues came in the form of relationships.

## What is a Relationship?

```notes
In any CMS users are going to want to create relationships.
In general a relationship is simple, an ID on item (in this case an article), will point to another related piece of data (in this case an author for that article).

```notes
In Zesty's context relationships are a little bit more complex. What matters here are that we dont just have content items, we have fields attached to those content items which define what they are and how they behave in different contexts.
```

## The Problem

```notes
In our list view here we see some articles. They have titles, images, dates, tags, and what we actually care about here is Authors.
```

---

## The Problem

<Image src="listview2.png" size="80%" />

```notes
In order to resolve these authors to the names you se here, we have to look up the item in our store, and then look up the correct field on that item. So the data we are dealing with could be incomplete in our store in two places. We may need to get fields, or the related author. Either one of these pieces missing will result in the UI not being able to display the author.
```

## Solutions

### App Layers

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Presentation Components</li>
    <li>Container Components</li>
    <li>Routing (HashRouter)</li>
    <li>Redux Store</li>
    <li>External Resources</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
In trying to find a solution to this, we had to make some decisons on where the best place in our app would be to resolve these kinds of relationships.
```

## Solutions

### Component level resolution

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>They are UI, and should be decoupled from this kind of logic</li>
    <li>This can lead to overly complex components</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
Resolving relationships in a container component is possible as they have access to the store and can dispatch actions. But this is a really bad idea as our use of redux allows us to decouple them from these concerns. They should only concerned with what and how to render our views.
```

## Solutions

<Image src="listview3.png" size="80%" />

```notes
  Here we see that the relationship column in this list view has multiple relationships that resolve to the same value or piece of content. If we did resolve the relationships in react it would result in many redundant requests.
```

---

## Solutions

### Redux action/reducer

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>This reduces predictability of our actions</li>
    <li>Redux provides a solution for these situations</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
Doing this in an action or reducer could make some sense as they are directly connected to the store and could be chained off of existing actions. This is however a slippery slope as these might lead to complicated actions that are less predictable.
```

---

## Solutions

### Middleware

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Does not interfere with UI behavior</li>
    <li>Our actions are unaware</li>
    <li>We can track our requests</li>
    <li>We have direct store access</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---

## Middleware

```javascript
export const fetchResource = store => next => action => {
  if (action.type === "FETCH_RESOURCE") {
    if (`The request is not already in flight`) {
      inflight.push(action.uri);
      return request(action.uri);
    }
  }
};
```

```notes
essentially we check here if the request is in flight. if not we go ahead and send the request off. if it's in the array we call next() to continue the redux action on.
```

---

## Middleware

```javascript
export const resolveFieldOptions = store => next => action => {
  if (action.type === "FETCH_FIELDS_SUCCESS") {
    if (`field contains relationships`) {
      parseRelationships().then(relatedItem => {
        dispatch({ type: "FETCH_RESOURCE", uri: `uri.to.${relatedItem}` });
      });
    }
  }
};
```

```notes
Now that we have resource requests de-duplicated, we have the chance to look at relationships at the first possible moment. Relationships are defined on the 'field', so if a field comes in that has a defined relationship, we can check the store for that data, and if it is not present, make a request for that resourse.
```

---

## Middleware

With this approach our other code is agnostic to relationship resolution.

Mental space is freed up to reason about other parts of the application.

---

## Middleware

Our redux store remains clean, components and actions are unaware that this is happening under the hood, and users dont have their browsers full of redundant requests.
